# Update via the webgui
1. Grab the updated file from [here](./files/) and upload to the miner via the webgui.
    - SHA256: 
        - `7138381F8337FA9D3CAE88D3B8B9481319894804A146E4EE08C014E551B8EE24     KS1update25.bgz`
2. Select the file from your local machine and click update.
3. Follow the prompts to reboot.
4. After about 2-5 minutes the webgui should be accessible again.  Miner hashrate will range bw 1180-1230 GH/s depending on silicon lottery.

We are working on a 40% bump as well, so stay tuned for that.
