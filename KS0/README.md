# Update via the webgui
1. Grab the updated file from [here](./files/) and upload to the miner via the webgui.
    - SHA256: 
        - `505B260AAC0D2C8ADB2A8EDE92951A5D7C1383DBD2D690568A09E41855FA6F37       update120.bgz`
        - `5142206B6AD5706C0D9D7BEFCA961A3C4B711ED6D12F0C2BDF8344EF8187C785       update140.bgz`
        - `71B361F90C9587FB3655DA9D4CBBDC5FC47F3F1050902917D0FC5FE032064959       update150.bgz`
        - `69557167DC490588A363989E2AF72C99686A4F459A535B2AAAE5D96D8C607924       update160.bgz`
2. We recommend starting with the update160.bgz file as it has the highest hashrate.  If you experience any under hashing issues, try the update140.bgz file.  If you further experience any under hashing issues that are under 80GH/s, try the update120.bgz file.
3. Select the file from your local machine and click update.
4. Follow the prompts to reboot.
5. After about 2-5 minutes the webgui should be accessible again.  Miner hashrate will range bw 140-160 GH/s depending on silicon lottery.

**Additional warning for those using this overclock, ensure you have the proper power supply to handle the increased power draw.  Some of the stock PSUs provided with the KS0 are not capable of handling the increased power draw. It is recommended to have at the very least 120w power supply.**
