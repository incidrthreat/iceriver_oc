# Overclocking Disclaimer for ASIC Crypto Miner

**PLEASE READ THIS DISCLAIMER CAREFULLY BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO OVERCLOCK YOUR ASIC**

1. **General Warning:** Overclocking your ASIC involves pushing the hardware beyond its factory-set limits. This can result in increased performance, butit also comes with inherent risks.

2. **Potential Risks:** Overclocking can lead to:
    - Reduced lifespan of the miner.
    - Permanent damage to the miner.
    - Increased power consumption.
    - Increased heat output, which can damage the miner and surrounding components.
    - Voiding of manufacturer's warranty.
    - Unstable mining performance or system crashes.

3. **No Guarantees:** While overclocking might increase the hashing power and potential earnings, there is no guarantee of performance improvement. In some cases,overclocking might even degrade performance.

4. **Warranty Void:** Overclocking your ASIC may void any warranty provided by the manufacturer or seller. It is your responsibility to check the terms ofyour warranty before overclocking.

5. **Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for any damage or loss caused by overclocking, including but not limited to hardware damage, data loss, reduced minerlifespan, and increased electricity costs. Neither the manufacturer, seller, nor any third parties will be held liable for any adverse effects resulting fromoverclocking.

6. **Cooling and Ventilation:** Ensure that the miner has adequate cooling and ventilation. Overclocking will generate additional heat, and failure to provide propercooling can lead to hardware failure.

7. **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the miner's temperature, performance, and stability. If you notice any irregularities, it is advisable to revert to the originalsettings or seek expert advice.

8. **Expertise:** If you are unsure about the overclocking process or its implications, seek advice from experts or professionals in the field. Overclocking without proper knowledge can lead to severe consequences.

9. **Backup:** Before making any changes, ensure you have backed up any critical data. Overclocking can lead to system instability, which might result in data loss.

10. **Consent:** By proceeding with overclocking, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to this disclaimer and accept all risks associated with theoverclocking process.
